# Overview

This project analyzes and predicts Healthy Life Expectancy at age 60 using machine learning models trained on World Health Organization (WHO) health and socio-economic data from 185 countries (2000–2019).
By combining robust data imputation, normalization, and model comparison, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods in capturing key determinants of healthy aging across populations.

# Data

The dataset is obtained from publicly available World Health Organization (WHO) global health records. It includes Healthy Life Expectancy at age 60 as the target variable along with multiple health, demographic, and socio-economic indicators.

The data covers 185 countries from 2000 to 2019, where each entry represents a country-year observation. This allows comparison across countries as well as analysis of trends over time.
