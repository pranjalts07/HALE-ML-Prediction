# Overview

This project analyzes and predicts Healthy Life Expectancy at age 60 using machine learning models trained on World Health Organization (WHO) health and socio-economic data from 185 countries (2000–2019).
By combining robust data imputation, normalization, and model comparison, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods in capturing key determinants of healthy aging across populations.
